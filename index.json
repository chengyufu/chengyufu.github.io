Previous literature has addressed three major theories: the distrust theory, trade theory, and the removal theory. However, the empirical analysis of how corruption perceptions and activities affect voter turnout is limited, especially for authoritarian regimes. Based on village-level elections data in China, this paper finds: (1) citizen perceptions of corruption depress turnout by lowering interest in elections, which is inconsistent with the removal theory but shows that distrust in elections can be one of the mediators; (2) both corruption perceptions and experienced corruption can raise people’s concern about Chinese democracy and consequently depress turnout; this mediation analysis reveals that corruption influences turnout through dwindling trust in the regime; (3) electoral corruption increases turnout directly, which supports the trade theory. Overall, although corruption can directly “buy” votes, it may undermine voting by decreasing political trust in both elections and the regime.","tags":null,"title":"Political Corruption and Voter Turnout: The Effects of Perception, Experience, and Purchases","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Scope. With the goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, direct air capture (DAC) of CO2 from wet flue gases is one brick of the carbon mitigation strategy – especially with the next generation of solid porous sorbents based on Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF). While thermodynamics of the CO2 capture is well documented in the literature, little is known about molecular diffusion and transport properties in MOF angstropores (in particular, in the presence of environmental humidity). Also, diffusion through pore scales of the applicative sorbing medium, ranging from nanopores (pore diameter ~nm) to macropores (\u0026gt; 50 nm) and beyond remain open. In order to fill the gap and gain insight into multiscale transport properties and try to figure CO2 capture optimization through MOF based sorbents, we ambition to develop a multiscale approach based on a lattice model fed by molecular simulations.\nIn more detail, the objective of this PhD proposal is two-fold. i. Using molecular simulations [e.g. Magnin et al. J. Phys. Chem. C 2022], we aim to unravel the molecular phenomena that govern the thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms when capturing CO2 using a multi-scale porous material. With this first aspect, we aim to rationalize the use of nanoporous materials for practical engineering processes by developing a robust and general methodology to link physico-chemical properties at different scales. ii. Using a bottom-up strategy, we will upscale the results obtained using atomistic simulations to mimic phase separation and transport of CO2/N2/H2O mixtures at the macroscale. To do so, a simple yet realistic lattice model [Botan et al. Phys. Rev. E 2015], which can be seen as a pore network model accounting for the change of the local thermodynamic/transport properties in a kinetic engineering process (e.g. Pressure Swing Adsorption), will be used.\nPotential candidate. The PhD candidate should have a background in physics, physical chemistry/chemical physics or materials science. He/she should also have some experience in scientific programming and a background in statistical mechanics (including if possible Monte Carlo or/and Molecular Dynamics).\nPractical aspects. The position is available starting January 2024 and lasts for 36 months. The PhD student will work under the supervision of Benoit Coasne/Simon Gravelle (LIPhy, Grenoble) and Yann Magnin (CSTJF, Pau). He/she will be located at LIPhy in Grenoble, France but several short stays in CSTJF in Pau, France will be planned.

However, it is unclear which underlying formal or informal norms shape the relationship between gender and corruption activities, especially in the private sector. This research investigates whether and why business women differ from businessmen in the probability of bribing. Using the China Micro and Small Enterprise Survey in 2015, I argue that (1) female business owners bribe significantly less often than their male counterparts; (2) formal institutional norms do not significantly mediate gender and corruption activities; and (3) informal social norms, e.g., business women being less aggressive and expansive, significantly mediate gender’s impact on firms’ corruption. This chapter thus questions the role of formal institutions in fostering gender differences in corruption. It also sheds light on the role of informal gender norms in influencing business owners’ bribery activities.","tags":null,"title":"Gender Norms and Firms' Corruption: Evidence from China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Chengyu Fu**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":16632e5,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":16632e5,"objectID":"70e3c6ab70832eb67a22ad015733d640","permalink":"https://chengyufu.github.io/publication/tax_evasion.html","publishdate":"2022-09-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tax_evasion.html","section":"publication","summary":"TBA","tags":null,"title":"Corruption and Tax Evasion: Evidence from China","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Update will be posted here.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"006f6f30ba9f03341dfbc41d9d1dd847","permalink":"https://chengyufu.github.io/project/hybrid-nanoporous-materials.html","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/hybrid-nanoporous-materials.html","section":"project","summary":"Ongoing MSCA project","tags":["Nanofluids"],"title":"Hybrid nanoporous materials for the separation of fluid mixtures","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":" Tests\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"60e79cb28829481c20d3db0f4695ad7c","permalink":"https://chengyufu.github.io/blog/about-me.html","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/about-me.html","section":"blog","summary":"Details.","tags":[],"title":"About Me","type":"blog"}]
