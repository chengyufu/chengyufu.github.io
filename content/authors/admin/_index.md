**About me**

Welcome! I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Charles and Louise Travers Department of Political Science at [University of California, Berkeley](https://polisci.berkeley.edu/), with a Designated Emphasis on Political Economy. My main research interests cover global investment, multinational corporations, and state-business relationship in emerging markets. Currently, I work on a project that explores how foreign high technology companies use non-market strategies to overcome regulatory barriers in the United States. My research has received funding from Berkeley Economy and Society Initiative ([BESI](https://ls.berkeley.edu/news/economy-and-society-initiative-launch-uc-berkeley-0)) and the Network for a New Political Economy ([N2PE](https://n2pe.berkeley.edu/)). 

Prior to doctoral studies, I gained experience at leading think tanks like the [American Enterprise Institute](https://www.aei.org/) and the [Center for Strategic and International Studies](https://www.csis.org/), where I worked on demographic policies and Chinese business and governance. I also served as a Research Assistant for the Institute of New Structural Economics at [Peking University](https://www.nse.pku.edu.cn/en/), focusing on development finance institutions. I earned my first M.A. in International Economics and International Relations from Johns Hopkins University, School of Advanced International Studies ([SAIS](https://sais.jhu.edu/)), second M.A. in Political Science from UC Berkeley, and Bachelor of Social Sciences from Hong Kong Baptist University, [United International College](https://www.uic.edu.cn/en/).
