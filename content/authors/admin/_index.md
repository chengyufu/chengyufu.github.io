**About me**

Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in the Travers Department of Political Science at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://polisci.berkeley.edu/), with a Designated Emphasis on Political Economy. My main research interests cover global investment, multinational corporations, and state-business relationship in emerging markets. Currently, I work on a project that explores how foreign high technology companies use non-market strategies to overcome regulatory barriers in the United States. My research has received funding from Berkeley Economy and Society Initiative ([BESI](https://ls.berkeley.edu/news/economy-and-society-initiative-launch-uc-berkeley-0)) and the Network for a New Political Economy ([N2PE](https://n2pe.berkeley.edu/)). 

Prior to doctoral studies, I worked at the [American Enterprise Institute](https://www.aei.org/), the [Center for Strategic and International Studies](https://www.csis.org/), and the [Institute of New Structural Economics](https://www.nse.pku.edu.cn/en/) at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). I earned my first M.A. in International Economics and International Relations from Johns Hopkins University, Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies ([SAIS](https://sais.jhu.edu/)), second M.A. in Political Science from UC Berkeley, and Bachelor of Social Sciences from [Hong Kong Baptist University, United International College](https://www.uic.edu.cn/en/).
