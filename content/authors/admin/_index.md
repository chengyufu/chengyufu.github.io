**About me**

Welcome! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Government at [Harvard University](https://www.gov.harvard.edu/). My main research interests cover the political economy of corruption, governance, and development. My research has received funding from [Berkeley Economy and Society Initiative](https://besi.berkeley.edu/) and [Network for a New Political Economy](https://n2pe.berkeley.edu/). Prior to doctoral studies, I earned my M.A. in Political Science from Duke University, and B.A. in Politics and Public Administration from Renmin University of China.
